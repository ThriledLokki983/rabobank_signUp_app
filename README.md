## Description

    * Build a production ready sign-up form page.
    * The form should allow users to enter first name, last name, email, and password.
    * All fields are required and validated.
    * Password validation:
        1. Should be a minimum of 8 characters,
        2. Should contain lower and uppercase letters,
        3. Should not contain user’s first or last name.
    * The valid form should send two sequential requests:
        1. POST form data to [API](https://demo-api.now.sh/users)
        2. Wait 4 seconds
        3. GET from [API](https://demo-api.now.sh/users)
            - I do fetch the data but as to what to do with the data I do not know because it was not specified and I do not want to do anything that is not specifically asked.
